# Connect-4

To access the game you will need a copy of the html, css and javascript file.

My game is Connect-4. It is a classic game with very simple rules, each player
is assigned a chip, in our case yellow and blue, you then take it
in turns to place a chip down in the grid, and the first player to match four of
their sticks either horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

To play the game you have to click any column on the grid and the chip will
automatically go the nearest available from the bottom of that column. It will
then switch automatically to the next player and he does the same, as long as
your the first to match your colour chips you win.

# My task

My task was to create a browser based game built using html, css and javascript.
before starting my game it had to be both agreed by me and my trainer, where we
discussed my wireframes. I created user stories which were spread between two
sprints, and was tracked using trello, updating it as I completed each
individual task. The first sprint was where we had to get a MVP for our game
and the second where we added any extra features.

My deliveries (user stores) included:

1. Created CSS and HTML to display layout of the game.
2. The chip alternated color between each players clicks and was correctly positioned in the grid
3. The horizontal, Vertical and diagonal winning conditions.
4. Browser telling the players who's turn it was.
5. Browser telling the player who won the game.
6. added sound effects.
7. added a reset button when the game was over.

The things I was most pleased with was:

1. I am pleased with the overall layout of the page, nothing collides with eachother.
2. I am happy that my researching skills were good, using stack overflow and w3 schools a lot for little problems.
3. This project helped improve my confidence in using jquery.
4. My winning conditions and the correct color displays on the grid.

The most challenging parts of the project were:

1. Using my original approach to sorting out the grid with regards to each player took me a very long time and I kept hitting dead ends.
2. Getting the logic of the game and how to implement it into my code.
